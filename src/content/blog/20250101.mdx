## ✨ Hello, hello, beautiful human! It’s 2025—Happy New Year!! 🪩

The future is here, and the tech world keeps moving at lightning speed. Whether you’re diving into AI, cybersecurity, web development, or building inclusive tech communities, 2025 is shaping up to be THE year for innovation and inspiration.

I’m starting my year by shining a light on 25 amazing humans and companies who are pushing boundaries, sharing knowledge, and showing up authentically in tech.

From engineers and DevRel stars to startups and open-source projects, these folks embody courage, creativity, and curiosity.

## ✨ Humans Who Inspire in Tech  ✨

These humans are the ones to watch, follow, and learn from in 2025. They share insights, build community, and keep the tech world moving forward—one idea, project, and post at a time. 

For ONCE going reverse alaphabet. Being a J name, I was always in the middle 😂
